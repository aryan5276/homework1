What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Answer: The main difference between merge and rebase is that merge preserves history, while rebase rewrites it.
When you merge, you are essentially taking two branches and combining them into one. This creates a new commit that points to both of the original commits. This new commit is called a merge commit.
When you rebase, you are taking all of the commits from one branch and applying them to another branch. This effectively moves the history of the branch forward.
